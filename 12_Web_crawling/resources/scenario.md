# robots.txt scenario

SecureBank (<code>http://securebank.com</code>) is a reputable online banking service known for its robust security measures. The bank’s website is designed to ensure the privacy and security of its customers' financial information. However, like many sites, it uses a <code>robots.txt</code> file to guide search engines about which parts of the site should not be indexed.

The publicly accessible <code>robots.txt</code> file for SecureBank looks like this:
``` shell
User-agent: *
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /private/
Disallow: /config/
```

An attacker conducting reconnaissance on SecureBank’s website stumbles upon the <code>robots.txt</code> file. The presence of directories like <code>/admin/</code>, <code>/private/</code>, and <code>/config/</code> catches their attention. These directories could potentially contain sensitive administrative interfaces or configuration files.

The attacker decides to investigate the <code>/admin/</code> directory further, assuming it might contain an admin login page or sensitive data. By navigating to <code>http://securebank.com/admin/</code>, the attacker finds a login page for SecureBank’s admin panel. However, without proper security measures, this panel is vulnerable to common attacks.

The attacker may use various methods to exploit the vulnerabilities found in the <code>/admin/</code> panel:
- brute force attack
- SQL injection
- stored XSS
